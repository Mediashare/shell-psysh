# Shell Tester README

## Overview

The Shell Tester is a tool for testing shell scripts and commands. It allows you to define test cases, execute them against your code, and verify the results.

## Getting Started

1.  **Navigate to the `test/shell-tester` directory.**
2.  **Review existing test cases:** Examine the files in this directory to understand how tests are structured and written.  The tests typically involve running a command or script, capturing its output, and asserting that the output matches an expected value.
3.  **Write new test cases:** Create new files in this directory, following the existing pattern.

## Test Case Structure

Each test case consists of the following elements:

*   **Command/Script to Execute:** The command or script that you want to test.
*   **Expected Output:** The output that you expect the command or script to produce.

## Contributing

1.  **Fork the repository.**
2.  **Create a new branch for your changes.**
3.  **Add your test cases to the `test/shell-tester` directory.**
4.  **Ensure that your test cases pass by running the test suite (details on how to run the test suite would go here if a testing framework was used).**
5.  **Submit a pull request.**

## Example Test Case

```bash
# This is an example test case.
# It tests the `ls -l` command.

command: ls -l
expected_output:
  - total 4
  - -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 1024 Jan 1 00:00 file1.txt
  - -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 2048 Jan 1 00:00 file2.txt
```

**Note:** The exact format of the test case may vary depending on the specific testing framework used.
